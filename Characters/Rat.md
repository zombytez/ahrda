## **Personality**
Rat hides scraps and trinkets away in many pockets. She is a little animalistic at times. She embraces changes, it's the natural order, she aims to misbehave. 

She owes her survival to Kat who taught her to live on the streets where she learned 'it's not stealing if I need it more than someone else'

## **Background**
Rat grew up on the streets of Falkirk never having known her parents and therefore her heritage, an aasimar. Life was tough but she made friends with another urchin child who tought her how to survive. Over time she fell in love with Kat. When she finally expressed these feelings to Kat she was heartbroken by an unrequited love. But then Falkirk was attacked. Many people were killed and some taken as slaves but what use is there for street rats? Kat and her cornered and mere moments from death, Rat prayed for the first time ever. And something answered... An unknown power struck out from her fear and anger and pain killing their attacker. Now they had a reason to take her. Even though she doesn't known it but all these events have tainted her aasimar heritage causing her to become a Fallen.

Rat was eventually reunited with Kat and even discovered where her power came from. The being that answered her prayers was herself a fallen angel known as Zariel turned archdevil of Avernus. For a while this was enough. She was with the one she loved and had gained control over her life again. But even this power was not enough to save Kat a second time. Realizing that she had sacrificed her morals and the power she craved had corrupted her and yet still didn't fix anything she turned on Zariel. Now she hopes to atone for her sins and perhaps regain her humanity.
